# Laravel Layout Module (SBAdmin)

This is an Admin Layout module for a Laravel application 8| 9| 10.
The idea is to isolate assets compilation and template pages for frontend/admin in a single, generic, reusable module.

the base is SBAdmin but updated to bootstrap 5.2


# Installation & configuration

```
composer require zofe/layout-module
```


# Testing routes

- /layout/test-admin
- /layout/test-auth



# Compilation 

from app/Modules/Layout you can run: 
```
npm run dev 
```

this will copy and replace all assets in your laravel public folder
